# Matthew Godwin, "Lord Thetford"
Hi! 👋 I'm **Matthew Godwin**, a senior software engineer with well over 6 years of professional experience designing, developing, and implementing a wide variety of custom software solutions for everything from supporting critical business applications to building data infrastructure for both business and operational intelligence.

I'm primarily a backend web developer and data engineer, although I have plenty of experience with frontend web development in React and operations technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. I also have certifications in both Microsoft Azure and Snowflake.

Currently looking for new professional opportunities, and excited to pick up new skills while honing the ones that I already possess!

## Who is "Lord Thetford"?
[Thetford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetford), in the English county of Norfolk, was the birthplace of [Thomas Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine) in 1737. Although he was never a lord, I've always had a special admiration for the forward-thinking author of [*Rights of Man*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_Man), and at some point I decided to honor him in a silly little way by making a username out of his hometown, upgrading him to nobility in the process.

## Who's that in your profile picture?
My profile picture is a bust of [Thomas Muir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Muir_of_Huntershill), another historical figure and contemporary of Paine who has long been an interest of mine. He lived a very eventful and interesting life, and I would very much like to do the same! (Perhaps minus the naval battles...)

> I have devoted myself to the cause of The People. It is a good cause – it shall ultimately prevail – it shall finally triumph.

(Thomas Muir, 30 August 1793)
